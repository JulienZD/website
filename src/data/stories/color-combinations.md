\<This article is still a work in progress>  
During my time as a developer I've come across many interesting and nice looking colors. To keep track of these I keep them in a text file. I quickly realized however, that there wasn't an easy way to view the combinations of them.  

To solve this problem I created this application that displays all the contrast-friendly color combinations in a handy grid.  
Note: The version in the image is a re-design that's still in development. The linked page is the original version.
